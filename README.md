# Banana Bunch

A novel consumer product for brands to rapidly iterate on their assets or product lines.

With the introduction of Nano Banana, AI image models have shown for the first time a remarkable ability to keep style consistent cross multiple images. Banana Bunch leverages this new ability to let brands just upload a few style/brand photos and then create "sets" of things that align with that style.

## Examples

Here are some sample images that demonstrate the types of assets you can work with:

<div >
  <img src="public/backpack.png" alt="Backpack Example" width="200" style="margin: 10px;">
  <img src="public/grass.png" alt="Grass Example" width="200" style="margin: 10px;">
  <img src="public/labubu.png" alt="Labubu Character Example" width="200" style="margin: 10px;">
  <img src="public/poke.png" alt="Poke Example" width="200" style="margin: 10px;">
</div>
