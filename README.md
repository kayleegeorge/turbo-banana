# Banana Bunch

A novel consumer product for brands to rapidly iterate on their assets or product lines.

With the introduction of Nano Banana, AI image image models have shown for the first time a remarkable ability to keep style and images consistent cross multiple images. Banana Bunch leverages this new ability to let brands just upload a few style/brand photos and then create "sets" of things that align with that style.
